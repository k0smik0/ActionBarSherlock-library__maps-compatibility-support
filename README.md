=========================================================

This is a fork of ActionBarSherlock.

It allows you can have FragmentMap in your app.

A new SherlockFragmentMapActivity (which extends FragmentMapActivity) is present

please careful to jars in libs. there are maps-compatibility fork, which permit to have FragmentMapActivity
you have to include these instead of original ones

for original readme see: [ActionBarSherlock library][1].
